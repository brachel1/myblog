<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>ableau is a powerful tool for making data visualizations. If you're like me your introduction to data visualization was through coding, using R and Python. However, not everyone is a computer programmer, and it takes time to learn how to do it that way. Tableau is a software that you can download on your computer that is much more user friendly and makes more streamlined charts. Today I'm going to go over the basics of Tableau, how to use it to clean data and create visualizations. </p>

# Functionality

<p>Before I get into how to create visualizations, first I wanted to go over some of the basic functions of Tableau. The first thing you need to do is open a new workbook and add a data source. As you can see below Tableau gives you a lot of options. You can pick the option that works for your data source and follow the instructions to add it. You can even add multiple data sources if desired. For today I'll be using just one data source which is an excel file. I’ll be using dataset about Amazon reviews.</p>

<p>Once you get all your data loaded in, you'll see a list of all of your field names on the left side. Tableau splits the fields into two categories, continuous and discreet. The blue ones at the top are discrete, and the green ones are continuous. To the left of the field name, you'll see an icon signifying what type of data: numeric, date, string, etc.</p>

# Data Cleaning

<p>What is data cleaning? If you're here you probably already know what data cleaning is, but for my purposes I'd still like to define it. Data cleaning is the process of identifying and fixing errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies. In short it is the process of during a raw data into something workable so you can perform analysis or create data visualizations. If you look at my dataset there isn't really anything numeric. The fields that are there are generated by Tableau. This means that we're going to need to do some data cleaning before we can make any visualizations. </p>

### Calculated Fields

<p>There's two fields that are currently strings, that we can turn numeric. We'll do this by creating what's called a calculated field. Before I create the calculated field, I need to see what the data looks like. I dragged the Rating field over to rows to see what kinds of values there are.</p>

![Fig Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brachel1/myblog/main/assets/img/image003.png)

<p>To create a calculated field you right click on the bar along the left side and this box will pop up.<p>

<p>After you click on calculated field this other box will appear.<p>

<p>Now this is where the magic happens. You can name your field anything you like. Then in the blank space below you can use SQL code to manipulate the fields. In this case I want to know how many starts they rated, so this was the code I used to make that possible. <p>

<p>After you hit OK you will create a calculated field and it will appear with your other fields<p>

<p>I do want to mention that the SQL in Tableau does have some limitations. It doesn't support all SQL queries, and can be different than some forms of SQL, but it can do most things that you can do elsewhere.<p>

### Filtering

<p>Another way that we can clean data is through filtering. You can drag any of the fields into the Filters box to create a filter for your data.<p>

<p>For discrete data like Country, it will give you a list and you can check the boxes of the data that you would like included.<p>

![Fig Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brachel1/myblog/main/assets/img/image005.png)

<p>For continuous data this page will appear. You can either choose all values, or pick an aggregation.<p>

![Fig Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brachel1/myblog/main/assets/img/image006.png)

<p>Then this page will appear and you can pick a range of values.<p>

![Fig Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brachel1/myblog/main/assets/img/image007.png)

<p>For dates you also have quite a few options. You can filter by month and year or by one month across all years<p>

![Fig Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brachel1/myblog/main/assets/img/image008.png)

<p>Depending on what you choose you'll see one of these two screens, similar to the ones for discrete and continuous data<p>

<p>One other note about filters is that you can make them interactive to your user. If you right click on it, then select show filter it will appear on the right side of the data visualization. Your user can then select what year, country, etc... they want to see and all the data in the chart will change to match.<p>

# Data Visualization

<p>Now that we've got all of our fields ready creating a data visualization is quite simple. Let's say I want a line graph of the average ratings over the last year in the US. All I need to do is drag the fields into place.<p>

![Fig Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brachel1/myblog/main/assets/img/image011.png)

<p>Now what if I wanted to Canada and Great Britain next to the US? I would add the additional countries to my filter. Then I can drag the country field to color in the marks tab underneath the filter tab and it will give me three lines in three different colors and give me a legend on the right side.<p>

![Fig Name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brachel1/myblog/main/assets/img/image012.png)

<p>If I want to change what kind of chart I'm looking at I can click on the Show Me button in the upper right hand corner and click on a different visualization type and it will change it for me.<p>

<p>This is just the beginning of data visualization in Tableau but it's enough to get you started. I invite you to upload your own data set and play around with it. Try creating a calculated field. You can play around with the different kind of charts you can make and the filters and the marks, there are so many more features that you can discover.<p>

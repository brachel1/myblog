<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post will be about an analysis of statics for the new Utah NHL hockey team. I will be discussing the process through which I acquired the data as well as an analysis of the data I found. </p>

### Introduction  

<p>Earlier this year Ryan Smith bought the Arizona Coyotes and brought them here to Utah. Since then a lot of changes have been made to the team. Many players stayed from the Arizona Coyotees, but they've also made a lot of additions to the team. I'm a big hockey fan, so I wanted to do a dive into who is expected to be our best players based on their previous stats.</p>

### Process

<p>For a project like this after coming up with a research question the first thing to do is find data sources. It's important to look at a website's robots.txt file before using a data source. That's how I decided on which site I was going to scrape data from. The first site I looked at didn't allow the data I wanted to be scraped, but another site did. I scraped my data from the<a href="https://www.nhl.com/utah/stats"> Utah Hockey Club</a> page on the NHL website.</p>

<p>The next step is to scrape the data. For my purposes I needed data from two different pages. I started with the page of the roster and scraped the player name, then the goal was to get a url and go to the player's personal page. The url embedded in the page, doesn't go to the page I want, so I had to scrape the player ID and construct the url that I needed. Then I scraped the career stats table from that page. I decided that I also wanted some of the information from that was on the original roster page, so I scraped that table as well, but kept it as a separate table. I linked the two in Tableau so that I could include some things like position in this analysis.</p>

<p>You can find the code that I used to scrape the data from my <a href="https://github.com/brachel1/blog2"> github repo</a>.</p>


### Analysis

<p>Before I get into my analysis, here's a list of what all the abbreviations for you to reference.</p>
<p>GP - Games Played</p>
<p>G - Goals</p>
<p>A - Assists</p>
<p>P - Points (a point is awarded for each goal or assist)</p>
<p>+/- - Plus-Minus (they get 1 point for every point score while they are on the ice and -1 for goals scored on them)</p>
<p>PIM - Penalties in Minute</p>
<p>PPG - Power Play Goals</p>
<p>PPP - Power Play Points</p>
<p>SHG - Shorthanded Goals</p>
<p>SHP - Shorthanded Points</p>
<p>GWG - Game Winning Goals</p>
<p>OTG - Overtime Goals</p>
<p>S - Shots on Goal</p>
<p>S% - Shooting Percentage</p>
<p>FO% - Face-Off Percentage</p>

<p>Positions:</p>
<p>C - Center</p>
<p>D - Defense</p>
<p>G - Goalie</p>
<p>LW - Left Wing</p>
<p>RW - Right Wing</p>
<p>(C, LW, and RW are all forward positions)</p>

<p>To start out my data analysis I created a correlation plot in Excel to see what factors are correlelated.</p>

<p>There's a lot of things in this plot that have high correlation that make a lot of sense. Things such as games played, goals, assists, points, shots all have high correlations with each other. One thing that surprised me though is that shooting percentage didn't have a high correlation with anything. I would have guessed that would have an effect on the number of goals, or the number of games played.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to get a sense of was a demographic of the players, and if there way any correlation between player size and position. We can see in the chart below that the defenseman are more clustered on the larger end whereas there's much more spread amongst the fowards.</p>

<p>To determine who are leading players are I made some bar charts to see who the leaders are in a few areas that I thought important. The first one is the number of goals in the 2022-2023 season. The clear leader is Clayton Keller, who is the team's captain, followed by Lawson Crouse, and Nick Bjugstad.</p>

<p>For the next metric I did my own calculation. I divided the number of goals, by the number of games for goals per game (GPG). This chart shows the average GPG for each player. Considering goals and games played are highly correlated, I expected the results to be much the same. Dylan Guenther was who I took the most note of. I've heard a lot about him, he signed an 8 year contract, so I knew he must be a pretty good player. I'd been surprised that he was more in the middle of the pack for goals last season, but looking at GPG helped to understand why they wanted to sign him for such a long contract.</p>

<p>The last metric I decided to look at is shooting percentage, which also gave some surprising results. I was surprised to see that the leader was a defenseman, with a percentage almost double the next highest defenseman. Dylan Guenther and Clayton Keller were farther down the list than I expected, and some players we haven't yet taken note of were in the top.It makes sense why shooting percentage wasn't highly correlated with any of the other metrics.</p>

### Next Steps

<p>This was just a very small look, to get some sense of who to look out for with the new team. To get a more in depth analysis of the team, I would probably want to look at the leaders for each or the metrics listed above. For this analysis I didn't use any data from the current season because it is still so early in the season, but once the season has gotten more underway these metrics can be evaluated, because a new team creates a new dynamic which might change some of the way some players play.</p>

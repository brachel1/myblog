<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">T</span>his post will be about an analysis of the new Utah NHL hockey team. I will be discussing the process through which I acquired the data as well as an analysis of the data I found. </p>

### Introduction  

<p>Earlier this year Ryan Smith bought the Arizona Coyotes and brought them here to Utah. Since then a lot of changes have been made to the team. Many players stayed from the Arizona Coyotes, but they've also made a lot of additions to the team. I'm a big hockey fan, so I wanted to do a dive into who is expected to be our best players based on their records.</p>

### Process

<p>For a project like this, after coming up with a research question the first thing to do is find data sources. It's important to look at a website's robots.txt file before using a data source to make sure the sight allows you to use their data. That's how I decided on which site I was going to scrape data from. The first site I looked at didn't allow the data I wanted to be scraped, but another site did. I scraped my data from the<a href="https://www.nhl.com/utah/stats"> Utah Hockey Club</a> page on the NHL website.</p>

<p>The next step is to scrape the data, I decided to use selenium and find the elements using xpath. For my purposes I needed data from two different pages. I started with the page of the roster and scraped the player name, then the goal was to get a url and go to the player's personal page. The url embedded in the page, didn't go to the page I wanted, so I had to scrape the player ID and construct the url that I needed. </p>

<p>Then I ran it through a loop so that I could go to each page and scrape their stats for each season played. After some thought, I decided that I also wanted some of the information from that was on the original roster page. I ended up writ ingit as a separate script and kept it as a separate table, but linked them in Tableau so I could use data from both in my analysis.</p>

<p>It was too much code to put all on here without cluttering the page, so if you'd like to look at the full code you can find the code that I used to scrape the data from my <a href="https://github.com/brachel1/blog2"> github repo</a>.</p>


### Analysis
<p>Before I get into my analysis, here's a list of what all the abbreviations for you to reference.</p>
<p>GP - Games Played</p>
<p>G - Goals</p>
<p>A - Assists</p>
<p>P - Points (a point is awarded for each goal or assist)</p>
<p>+/- - Plus-Minus (they get 1 point for every point score while they are on the ice and -1 for goals scored on them)</p>
<p>PIM - Penalties in Minute</p>
<p>PPG - Power Play Goals</p>
<p>PPP - Power Play Points</p>
<p>SHG - Shorthanded Goals</p>
<p>SHP - Shorthanded Points</p>
<p>GWG - Game Winning Goals</p>
<p>OTG - Overtime Goals</p>
<p>S - Shots on Goal</p>
<p>S% - Shooting Percentage</p>
<p>FO% - Face-Off Percentage</p>

<p>Positions:</p>
<p>C - Center</p>
<p>D - Defense</p>
<p>G - Goalie</p>
<p>LW - Left Wing</p>
<p>RW - Right Wing</p>
<p>(C, LW, and RW are all forward positions)</p>

<p>To start out my data analysis I created a correlation plot in Excel to see what factors are correlelated.</p>

<p>There's a lot of things in this plot that have high correlation that make a lot of sense. Things such as games played, goals, assists, points, shots all have high correlations with each other. One thing that surprised me though is that shooting percentage didn't have a high correlation with anything. I would have guessed that would have an effect on the number of goals, or the number of games played.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to get a sense of was a demographic of the players, and if there way any correlation between player size and position. We can see in the chart below that the defenseman are more clustered on the larger end whereas there's much more spread amongst the forwards.</p>

<p>To get a small look into who some of the best players are I made a bar chart of number of goals in the 2022-2023 season. The clear leader is Clayton Keller, who is the team's captain, followed by Lawson Crouse, and Nick Bjugstad.</p>

### Next Steps

<p>This was just a very small look, to get some sense of who to look out for with the new team. To get a more in depth analysis of the team, I would probably want to look at the leaders for each or the metrics listed above. For this analysis I didn't use any data from the current season because it is still so early in the season, but once the season has gotten more underway these metrics can be evaluated, because a new team creates a new dynamic which might change some of the way some players play. Take your own dive into this data! There's still much to be discovered!</p>
